-- These are all of my plugins. I plan to remove lazy.nvim once Neovim 1.0 is released and plugins target this stable
-- version. Possibly with 0.12 when Neovim has a built in package manager. I'm also thinking about removing undotree. I
-- find that undotree makes me reliant on my undo history instead of git committing changes more often.
